# Cardiovascular Disease Cellular Phenotype Analysis

## Overview

This study investigates cellular phenotypes present in two cardiovascular disease aetiologies:
- **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)**
- **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (ICM)**

### Study Parameters
- **Sample Size**: 16 patients (8 per aetiology)
- **Analysis Method**: Statistical investigation using proportion of phenotype cells in each Region of Interest (ROI)

---

## Key Findings

### üî¨ Goal 1: Phenotype Comparison Across Fibrotic Zones (Within Aetiology)

**Objective**: Compare cellular phenotypes present with different Fibrotic Zones **within** ICM patients and **within** DCM patients.

#### Significant Phenotypes by Aetiology:

**ICM Patients:**
> C1, C2b, C3a, CD45RO, Fib2, Fib3, Fibrocyte2, M2, PopSMA+Fx13a+, ResMac, SMA1, SMA3, C2a, Activated Th, SMA2

**DCM Patients:**
> C1, C2a, CD45RO, Fib3, M2, PopS100+, PopSMA+Fx13a+, ResMac, SMA1, C4, LymphEndo, SMA3, Mast

### üîÑ Goal 2: Phenotype Comparison Between Aetiologies

**Objective**: Compare cellular phenotypes present within different Fibrotic Zones **between** ICM and DCM patients.

| Fibrotic Zone | Significantly Different Phenotypes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **IF Zone** | M2, LymphEndo, Fib3, C3b |
| **RF Zone** | Fib3, LymphEndo, C3b |

### üìä Goal 3: Phenotype-Fibrosis Score Relationships

**Objective**: Compare the relationship between phenotype abundance and Fibrosis Score within ICM and DCM patients.

#### ICM Patients:
- **Positive Relationships with Fibrosis Score** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è: C1, C2b, C3a, Fib1, C2a
- **Negative Relationships with Fibrosis Score** ‚¨áÔ∏è: Neutrophil1

#### DCM Patients:
- **Positive Relationships with Fibrosis Score** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è: C1, C2a, C3a, Fib1, C2b, C4, Mast
- **Negative Relationships with Fibrosis Score** ‚¨áÔ∏è: M2
