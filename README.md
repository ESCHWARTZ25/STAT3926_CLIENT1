The client presents a study investigating cellular phenotypes present in two cardiovascular disease Aetiologies, Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (ICM). Based on a sample of cellular marking results from 16 patients (8 within each Aetiology) and a conversation with the client, three key goals were identified. Using the proportion of phenotype cells in a given ROI, this statistical investigation found the following results for each goal:

Compare cellular phenotypes present with different Fibrotic Zones within ICM patients and within DCM patients.

Within each Aetiology, the following cellular phenotypes demonstrated a significant difference in phenotype proportion between Fibrotic zones:

ICM: C1, C2b, C3a, CD45RO, Fib2, Fib3, Fibrocyte2, M2, PopSMA+Fx13a+, ResMac, SMA1, SMA3, C2a, Activated Th and SMA2

DCM: C1, C2a, CD45RO, Fib3, M2, PopS100+, PopSMA+Fx13a+, ResMac, SMA1, C4, LymphEndo, SMA3 and Mast

Compare cellular phenotypes present within different Fibrotic Zones between ICM and DCM patients.

For the IF Fibrotic Zone, mean phenotype proportion was significantly different between ICM and DCM samples within M2, LymphEndo, Fib3 and C3b phenotypes. In the RF Fibrotic Zone, average phenotype proportion was significantly different for Fib3. LymphEndo and C3b phenotypes.

Compare the relationship between phenotype abundance and Fibrosis score within ICM and DCM patients.

The relationship between phenotype proportion and Fibrosis Score was significant for the following phenotypes within each aetiology:

ICM: Positive Relationship: C1, C2b, C3a, Fib1 and C2a; Negative Relationship: Neutrophil1

DCM: Positive Relationship: C1, C2a, C3a, Fib1, C2b, C4 and Mast; Negative Relationship: M2
